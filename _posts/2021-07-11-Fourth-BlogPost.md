title: Project 2 Discussion    
---    

Great learning experience again with one of Dr.Post's tough projects. I made sure to have an early start on this project and things went great at the beginning. i made sure to read the ISLR book for chapters 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and have a great undestanding of linear regressions, classifications, prediction models using caret package combined with other statistical methods such as Random Forest and Boosting which can be applied in regression and classifications.

My biggest stressful moments are always when it comes to submission, the repo sometimes it renders and accept the push and sometimes it doesn't, many occasions ended up just restrating laptop and starting all over again since it turns out the problem is from R itself. Automation idea was easy and straight forward from the notes but applying the automation after each commit by either of the partners was resulting in a stressful momnets of debugging.

The communication with my partner was fair - i'm not aware if my partner was local in raleigh or overseas as i had to wait long on replies but it's completely understandable as everything got resolved at the end thankfully.

Friday and Saturday (2 days before submission) i realized that i need to start on wrapping up the work but each time i was getting delayed with something new to add or delete to the project.

lessons learned: I've learned from project 1 is to start as eary as possible on project 2 and this is what happened. I've learned from Project 2 is to hopefully finish early on Project 3.

My takeaways is to never underestimate time when it comes to coding - time could easily run away especially when working on a project with a group of memebers and each member of the group is waiting on the other for their collaboration. My biggest takeaway is seing and feeling the world differently after learning that much in R and we are not done yet with the semester - R literally opens the doors of the future!
