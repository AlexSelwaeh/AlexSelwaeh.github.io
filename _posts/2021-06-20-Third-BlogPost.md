title: Project 1 Discussion    
---    

I've had a wrong start to the project where i attended office hours and thought i'm doing myself a favor. I started listening to everyone's questions and got myself overwhelmed before even reading the project requirements. At first, i had a misunderstanding on what the first couple endpoints would be used for. Then my hardship started when i was trying to pass id and name as argumets for the same function so i started building my code as an Rscript then had to change everything based on the correct understanding of how to use the endpoints. 
Timing for the project was more than enough, I just ended up being delayed and interrupted due to the current work flow im facing in the last couple weeks where i'm working almost 80 hrs to fullfill shortage in staff. I tried to divide my time very wisely, i was able to put at least 5 hrs of work a day on this project (but those 5 hrs were not in one sit down- they were on stages through the day). I started the repo about a week before submission then had to create another repo because i was not sure what i was doing until finally i created the project repo on saturday morning and started associating all my project work with it. Finally, i had a little obstacle in figuring out how to render the file, and how to create the README file but it worked out well at the end. The biggest delay i've faced is when my .RMD file was not knitting so i had to recreate my work on a new .Rmd and that's why my repo has multiple files in it but the homework official submission file is this one : Project1ST558Copy1


I can say it took me about 30 hrs total to finish the project and that's only due to distractions. The project is fairly not hard and not easy, it's well surrounded around the materials weve learned so far from `Basic R`. 

lessons learned: tackle the project by first reading it and try to understand it and digest it before hearing other's questions about it which will definitely distract my focus. 

This is a tough semester, but what this class offers outweighs everything and it's worth the sacrifice.
