title: Experience with R  
---    

__Personal Experience with R__:  

* I had a brief introduction to `R` when i took __ST501__ during the Summer of 2020. I have a good programming skills in python which helped me to understand R quicker.       
* During my undergraduate studies, I've taken __C++__ and __FORTRAN__,__MATLAB__.  
  + Years 2013,2014 respectively. 
* What i like the most about `R` is it's flexibility through providing an enormous amount of packages with functions that facilitates the job of the programmer or a Data Scientists.    
* In my opinion, i don't think `R` is a difficult language to learn, but probably learning how to put all the packages that R provides and knowing what type of functions they offer and how to use is the difficult part-but it's still easier to learn when compared to SAS or any other programming language that i've learned before.  
* I've taken __ST555(SAS)__ and __ST556(advanced SAS)__ in _Fall2020_ and _Spring2021_ respectively. The pictue is becoming clear to me that `R` is capable of doing what __SAS__ can't do.
