title: Experience with R  
---  
  -I had a brief introduction to R when i took ST501 during the Summer of 2020. I have a good programming skills in python which helped me to understand R quicker.     
  -During my undergraduate studies, I've taken C++ and FORTRAN,MATLAB.  
  -What i like the most about R is it's flexibility through providing an enormous amount of packages with functions that facilitates the job of the programmer or a Data Scientists.  
  -In my opinion, i don't think R is a difficult language to learn, but probably learning how to put all the packages that R provides and knowing what type of functions they offer and how to use is the difficult part-but it's still easier to learn when compared to SAS or any other programming language that i've learned before.  
  -I've taken ST555(SAS) and ST556(advanced SAS) in Fall2020 and Spring2021 respectively. The pictue is becoming clear to me that R is capable of doing what SAS can't do.
