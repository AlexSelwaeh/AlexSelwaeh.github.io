__Reflection R__:  

* Nothing has changed about what i think a data scientist is and what they do.    
* I'll definitely continue to use `R` going forward - the flexibiltity that `R` offers is magnificent when compared to _SAS_ for example. In my opinion, R is way more superior than SAS.   
* I'm going to be able to use it on my day to day business operations either when it comes to managing inventory ordering based on distributers, inventory pricing based on types  of products,Customer data management, website order inventory, etc.. Probably use R to do predictions on busy hours of operations of a certain day utilizing poisson distribution tree model analysis.Furthermore, I'm going to be able to investigate any data on my own and verify if the claims stated by any statistical report to be either True or False claims.
